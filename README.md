# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This is a REact BAsed Job search web site which helps us search jobs.
1)I have used Login page as the loading page, and will redirect user to the home page, when he logged in.  
2)If he tries to access something, without logging in he will be redirected to login page.
3)I have used map to generate components on the jobs page.
4)I have used React Cards in all the pages, to display data.
